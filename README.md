 The purpose of this model is to assist in the data exploration process by quickly identifying patterns, relationships, and outliers within the data, which can help researchers or analysts to better understand the underlying structure of the data.
 
 An automated EDA model typically involves several steps, including data preprocessing, variable identification, missing value imputation, feature engineering, and statistical analysis. During the preprocessing stage, the model cleans and prepares the data by removing any irrelevant or duplicate information. Next, the model identifies the variables that are relevant to the analysis and removes any redundant or highly correlated variables.

Once the variables have been identified, the model imputes any missing values in the data, and then performs feature engineering to create new features or transform existing features to better represent the data. After feature engineering, the model conducts statistical analysis to identify trends, correlations, and patterns in the data, and generates visualizations and summary statistics to aid in interpretation.

Overall, an automated EDA model can save a significant amount of time and effort in the data exploration process, as it can quickly generate insights and highlight important features of the data, without requiring manual intervention. This can be particularly useful in large-scale data analysis projects where manual exploration may not be feasible.
